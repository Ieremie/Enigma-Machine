Enigma Coursework

 1. Parts
	- Input from a file and output to a file
	- Both 3 challenges completed
	- Completed all the Enigma Machine specs
	
 2. Extensions and usage
	- Add in input.txt the message you want to be decrypted and run the code. Write the
	whole message on ONE LINE!
	
	- The user can choose to run a challenge or to decrypt a message. To choose
	a challenge, type "bombe", press enter and type "1" or "2" or "3". Example:
	
	bombe
	2
	
	- To choose a normal decryption, type "enigma". Then, you have to say 
	  which plugs you connect respecting this format:
	  "first character of the plug" "second character of the plug", press enter
	  and so on. To finish with the plugs, type "finish". Example:
	  
	  A B
	  G F
	  finish
	
	  Then, you will be instructed to choose the rotors in the specified order (first
	  you will add the rotor from slot 2, then from slot 1, then from slot 0).
	  The format is: "rotor type" "position" and press enter. For simple rotors the command is
	  "I" or "II", and so on according to its type, for turnover rotors the command
	  is "turnI" or "turnII", and so on according to its type. Example:
	  
	  II 20
	  turnI 10
	  IV 9
	  
	  Then, you will have to add the reflector. Type "ReflectorI" or "ReflectorII" and press enter. Example:
	  
	  ReflectorII
	  
	- Look for the results in output.txt. All these instruction will appear in the
	  console as well. If you write an incorrect command, run the code again!
	  
 3. Extension description
	- The extension I chose to do was a command line interface. In additions to this,
	the user can also choose the challenge to be ran from the command line interface.
